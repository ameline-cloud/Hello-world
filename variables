//a variable is a string that carry data value
//variable creation is a 2 step process
//step 1. declare 
//step 2. initialize
//you can declare a variable in one line 
//and then assign its value on other line
// int x; declare
// x = 5; initialize
// x = 9; yes thats right the value of x
//can change at some point thats why its a variable 
//or you can declare and initialize on the same line
//Variables declared globally have a global scope 
//Variables declared within a function are scoped to that 
//function and shadow global variables of the same name
